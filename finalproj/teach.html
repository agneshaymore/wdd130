              Teaching using multiple modalities will help all types of learners
              to learn. For example, if a young child has difficulty sitting at
              a desk, then draw a number chart on the ground and have the child
              hop to do their math homework. Another example is the
              manipulatives used in classrooms at a desk. Think about involving
              the different senses of the learners when we try teach.

              Some learners are more inclined to look when the instructor uses a
              pointer instead of a hand or finger. Some individuals with autism
              tend to be more focused on objects. Merely speaking is the least
              effective method to teach individuals who are more impacted by
              learning differences.

            <p>
              When the instructor asks the learner a question to try to gauge
              understanding, the instructor should switch the order of the
              choices. For example, ask, or better still, present or write the
              options. First present maybe the correct answer then the
              detractor. Afterwards switch and present the detractor then the
              correct answer. Some individuals with learning differences may
              reply with either the first or last thing they heard; this is the
              reason for switching the order of the options.

              Attention span is a curious thing. It is definitely important to
              provide frequent breaks. However, adapting the learner's
              environment can be helpful to sustain attention. For example, give
              the learner the option of sitting on a gym ball instead of a
              chair, or at the very least, offer a wiggle cushion. Another
              affordable option is to provide a pedal cycle under the desk so
              that the learner could have movement without distracting the
              others around. A more costly but effective alternative is to do
              reading and type notes at a walking treadmill desk.

              Technology can be a lifeline to help those with moderate-severe
              developmental disabilities to learn complicated daily tasks. For
              example, the process of taking a shower involves a few tasks which
              involves many steps each. We could break down a task into the very
              small steps involved and teach the small steps. It is common that
              some individuals with moderate-severe developmental disabilities
              may have difficulty sequencing the steps to perform a task. This
              is where the blessing of technology helps to teach. We could use a
              tablet and upload the individual steps of a task as slides, then
              in time, even those with moderate-severe learning differences
              could learn to do complicated daily tasks for themselves.

              Yes, do give more time for individuals with learning differences
              to process before answering. In addition, consider options for
              those with some expressive language challenges to be able to
              answer.

              Having the learners engage one another in the learning process
              could be helpful for learners with mild learning differences.
              However, this might be difficult for learners with moderate-severe
              developmental disabilities.

              This video is self-explanatory. Movement is also helpful in the
              learning process. For example, have the student go bring the
              correct answer to win tokens.

            <p>
              This is important; reducing anxiety could help reduce behavioral
              issues. If the learner does not read yet, then a picture schedule
              could be use. A visual timer, like the Time Timer, which shows how
              much time is remaining for the current stage, has been helpful.

              In addition to what this video states, it is more effective
              communication when we speak in the affirmative. For example,
              instead of saying, "don't run," we should say, "please walk." When
              we say, "don't run," we have not provided clear instruction on
              what behavior we expect instead. Another example is, instead of
              saying, "don't sit on the tables," we should say, "please sit on
              the chair." By speaking in the affirmative, we provide clear
              instruction about what is expected.
