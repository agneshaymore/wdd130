              Teaching using multiple modalities will help all types of learners
              to learn. For example, if a young child has difficulty doing math
              homework sitting at a desk, then draw a number chart on the ground
              and have the child hop to do their math homework. A more common
              example we see in classrooms at a desk is to use manipulatives to
              help the students visualize. Think about involving the different
              senses of the learners when we try teach.

              Some learners who are more object focused are more inclined to
              look when the instructor uses a pointer and visuals or objects.
              Merely speaking is the least effective method to teach individuals
              who are more impacted by learning differences.

              When the instructor asks the learner a question to try to gauge
              understanding, the instructor should switch the order of the
              choices. For example, ask, present or write the options. First,
              present maybe the correct answer then the detractor. Afterwards,
              switch and present the detractor then the correct answer. Some
              individuals with learning differences may reply with either the
              first or last thing they heard; this is the reason for switching
              the order of the options.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Attention span is a curious thing. Some students who have very
              short attention spans seem capable of fixating on something. It is
              definitely important to provide frequent breaks. However, adapting
              the learner's environment can be helpful to sustain attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, give the learner the option of sitting on a gym ball
              instead of a chair, or at the very least, offer a wiggle cushion.
              Another affordable option is to provide a pedal cycle under the
              desk so that the learner could have movement without distracting
              the others around. A more costly but effective alternative is to
              do reading and type notes at a walking treadmill desk. All these
              options provide the learner with movement on the spot, and thus
              may help sustain attention without distracting other learners in
              class.

              The common figit objects we see used in classrooms are finger
              figit toys, textured balls, chewable pencil toppers or necklaces,
              and weighted vests. Even a simple thing like having the correct
              pencil grips could make it more comfortable for a learner to
              continue working.

            <p>
              Technology can be a lifeline to help those with developmental
              differences to learn complicated daily tasks. For example, the
              process of taking a shower involves a few tasks which are each
              comprised of many steps. We could break down a task into the small
              steps involved and teach each small step.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is common for some individuals with developmental differences
              to have difficulty sequencing the steps involved to perform a
              task. This is where the blessing of technology helps us to teach.
              For example, we could use a tablet and upload the individual steps
              of a task as slides, then in time, even these learners with
              developmental differences could learn to do complicated daily
              tasks for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another example is to use software to help learners organize
              themselves. These software not only provides a checklist, but also
              allows the caregiver or teacher to cluster tasks in a block if it
              does not matter which task is done first.

              Yes, do give more time for individuals with learning differences
              to process before answering. In addition, consider options for
              those with some expressive language challenges to be able to
              answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another dimension to wait time is to teach a task in incrementally
              small steps to reduce anxiety. Also see Part 9 below. For example,
              learning to go to the doctor's or dentist's office could involve
              weeks of work. In week 1, we would drive to the place. In week 2,
              we would also get out of the car. In week 3, we would also walk
              across the parking lot. In week 4, we would also walk to the
              building entrance. In week 5, we would also walk inside the
              building to the lobby. In week 6, we would go upstairs. In week 7,
              we would go the the doctor's office lobby. In week 8, the doctor
              would say hello. In week 9, we may go inside the doctor's office.
              In week 10, the individual with developmental differences may let
              the doctor perform a cursory physical examination but if and only
              if the caregiver has practiced with the learner all these weeks at
              home what the doctor might do to examine the patient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Helping the individual with developmental differences overcome
              sensory integration disorder issues also requires similar wait
              time to teach. For example, learning to tolerate a nail clipper
              involves months of desensitizing. The frequency used in this case
              was at least every other day. In week 1, place the nail clipper
              beside the learner. In week 2, the learner would touch the nail
              clipper. In week 3, the learner would hold the nail clipper and
              touch his/her own toes. In week 4, the learner might tolerate the
              caregiver touching his/her toes with the nail clipper. With some
              luck, in week 5, the learner might tolerate the caregiver clipping
              part of a toenail with a single clip. There is no magic formula,
              it just takes time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Community safety awareness is more urgent to learn, but this still
              takes time to learn. It is safer to practice in a quiet location
              without too many cars driving by. For example, the learner with
              developmental differences has to learn to stand by the car when
              getting out instead of running around the parking lot unaware.
              Similarly, the learner has to learn to stop at the street corner
              and wait, but first the learner has to recognize what a street
              corner is. This involves visiting different street corners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that in some cases, the learner's lack of generalization
              skills means that even though the learner may perform a task in a
              particular setting, the learner may have difficulty adapting
              his/her learned skill to a different setting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that the learning process cannot be rushed because the
              learner's anxiety level the next time we try to teach would become
              more difficult to overcome.

              Having the learners engage one another in the learning process
              could be helpful for learners with mild learning differences.
              However, this might be difficult for learners with moderate-severe
              developmental disabilities.

              This video is self-explanatory. Movement is also helpful in the
              learning process. For example, have the student go bring the
              correct answer to win tokens.

            <p>
              This is important; reducing anxiety could help reduce behavioral
              issues. If the learner does not read yet, then a picture schedule
              could be use. A visual timer, like the Time Timer, which shows how
              much time is remaining for the current stage, has been helpful.

              In addition to what this video states, it is more effective
              communication when we speak in the affirmative. For example,
              instead of saying, "don't run," we should say, "please walk." When
              we say, "don't run," we have not provided clear instruction on
              what behavior we expect instead. Another example is, instead of
              saying, "don't sit on the tables," we should say, "please sit on
              the chair." By speaking in the affirmative, we provide clear
              instruction about what is expected.
