            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>

            <p>
              In the spirit of Relief Society, my hope is that this information
              might "work in unity to help those in need".
            </p>

            <p>
              The purpose of this website is to corral the combined local
              knowledge of our Relief Society sisters in the Woodland Park Ward,
              Los Altos CA Stake, to be just one click away.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Woodland Park Ward's Relief Society sisters currently share
              our knowledge of local resources via a Google Groups email list.
              While it is helpful to read the information as the emails come, it
              would be infinitely more helpful to have this information be just
              a click away on a website as and when someone needs the
              information.
            </p>

            <p>The website's categories of information include:</p>

            <p>
              -- online or other resources to supplement our children's school;
              this is helpful to have handy in case all parents have to home
              school again;
            </p>
            <p>
              -- family friendly hiking trails and outdoor activities not too
              far from the South San Francisco Bay Area;
            </p>
            <p>-- recipes popular with our local Ward;</p>
            <p>
              -- perhaps share how we successfully taught something difficult.
            </p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>

            <p>
              This site is a resource for parents as the Wards in our Stake have
              a high turnover rate. This information would also be helpful for
              mentors or teachers and family friends.
            </p>

            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>

            <p>
              The color scheme I will use are colors from citrus trees that grow
              naturally in our area.
