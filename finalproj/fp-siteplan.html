          <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the spirit of Relief Society, my hope is that this information
            might "work in unity to help those in need".
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of this website is to corral the combined local
            knowledge of our Relief Society sisters in the Woodland Park Ward,
            Los Altos CA Stake, to be just one click away.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Woodland Park Ward's Relief Society sisters currently share our
            knowledge of local resources via a Google Groups email list. While
            it is helpful to read the information as the emails come, it would
            be infinitely more helpful to have this information be just a click
            away on a website as and when someone needs the information.
            <br />
            <br />
            The website's categories of information include:
            <br />
            <br />
            online or other resources to supplement our children's school; this
            is helpful to have handy in case all parents have to home school
            again
            <br />
            <br />
            family friendly hiking trails and outdoor activities not too far
            from the South San Francisco Bay Area
            <br />
            <br />
            recipes popular with our local Ward
            <br />
            <br />
            perhaps share how we successfully taught something difficult.

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            This site is a resource for parents as the Wards in our Stake have a
            high turnover rate. This information would also be helpful for
            mentors or teachers and family friends.
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>

        <div class="colorscheme">
          <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The color scheme I will use are colors from citrus trees that grow
            naturally in our area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, I may use a photo of the Oakland Temple as the hero
            image and thus use colors from the Oakland Temple photograph for the
            header/footer.

            <h2>Hikes</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>John Nicholas trail at Sanborn County Park</h3>
            <p>
              Mountain biking trails. There is a flat/easy section at the
              beginning and then you can continue up the more steep and
              challenging section which takes you to the Ridge Trail on top of
              the hill.
            </p>

            <h3>Almaden Quicksilver County Park</h3>
            <p>
              Some nice trails for hiking or biking. There is some mining
              equipment/information on display.
            </p>

            <h3>Calero County Park</h3>
            <p>
              A favorite place to bike. Try the Lisa Killough trail and Cottle
              Trail loop.
            </p>

            <h3>Goat Rock Overlook Loop at Castle Rock State Park</h3>
            <p>
              A favorite hike about 3-4 miles and it has views of the Santa Cruz
              mountains and a waterfall if youâ€™re lucky.
            </p>

            <h3>Golden Gate National Recreation Area</h3>
            <p>Definitely worth a visit. Great views of SF and the Bay.</p>

            <h3>Uvas Canyon near Morgan Hill</h3>
            <p>A beautiful and shady place to hike.</p>

            <h3>Mount Tamalpais State Park</h3>
            <p>
              A lot to offer. Try the Cataract Falls hike and the Dipsea/Steep
              Ravine Loop. For the Dipsea trail, a hike down to Stinson Beach
              has a snack shack for a mid hike break.
            </p>

            <h3>Point Reyes National Seashore</h3>
            <p>Worth a visit.</p>
