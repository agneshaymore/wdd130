            <h1>The collective wisdom of RS sisters on selected topics:</h1>
            <p>this is not an official Church site of the Woodland Park Ward.</p>

            <div class="sitepurpose">
                <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this website is to corral the combined local knowledge of our Relief Society sisters in the Woodland Park Ward, Los Altos CA Stake, to be just one click away.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Woodland Park Ward's Relief Society sisters currently share our knowledge of local resources via a Google Groups email list.  While it is helpful to read the information as the emails come, it would be infinitely more helpful to have this information be just a click away on a website as and when someone needs the information.
                <br>
                <br>
                The website's categories of information include:
                <br>
                <br>
                    online or other resources to supplement our children's school; this is helpful to have handy in case all parents have to home school again
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    family friendly hiking trails and outdoor activities not too far from the South San Francisco Bay Area
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    recipes popular with our local Ward
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    perhaps share how we successfully taught something difficult.

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>This site is a resource for parents as the Wards in our Stake have a high turnover rate. This information would also be helpful for mentors or teachers and family friends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorscheme">
                <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
                <p>The color scheme I will use are colors from citrus trees that grow naturally in our area.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hikes">
                <h2>Hikes</h2>
                <p>Bay Area Trails: John Nicholas trail at Sanborn County Park -- mountain biking trails. There is a flat/easy section at the beginning and then you can continue up the more steep and challenging section which takes you to the Ridge Trail on top of the hill.</p>

                <p>Almaden Quicksilver County Park: some nice trails for hiking or biking. There is some mining equipment/information on display.</p>

                <p>Calero County Park: a favorite place to bike. Try the Lisa Killough trail and Cottle Trail loop.</p>

                <p>Goat Rock Overlook Loop at Castle Rock State Park: a favorite hike about 3-4 miles and it has views of the Santa Cruz mountains and a waterfall if youâ€™re lucky.</p>

                <p>Golden Gate National Recreation Area: definitely worth a visit. Great views of SF and the Bay.</p>

                <p>Uvas Canyon near Morgan Hill: a beautiful and shady place to hike.</p>

                <p>Mount Tamalpais State Park: a lot to offer. Try the Cataract Falls hike and the Dipsea/Steep Ravine Loop. For the Dipsea trail, a hike down to Stinson Beach has a snack shack for a mid hike break.</p>

                <p>Point Reyes National Seashore: worth a visit.</p>
