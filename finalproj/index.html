                In this site, I have compiled some ideas which were informally
                shared in my church women's organization over a period of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope it would be helpful to have this resource list collated
                into one repository.

                “The ability to qualify for, receive, and act on personal
                revelation is the single most important skill that can be
                acquired in this life,” ... “With [personal revelation] we
                cannot fail; without it we cannot succeed.” —Julie B. Beck,
